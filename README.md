### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




I am a graduate of the Higher School of Banking, majoring in computer science, specializing in programming, and of the Gdansk University of Technology, majoring in electrical engineering.
I became interested in programming in my previous studies, where the main programming language was C. 

I spent the most time learning to program in Python, which is also one of my favorites.
